# Credit Risk Analyzer & Agentic Underwriting Copilot

**Explainable AI Lending System with Automated OCR Agent**

An end-to-end machine learning system that predicts credit card default risk, provides explainable AI insights via SHAP, and features a built-in LangChain Agentic Copilot to automate document parsing via OCR.
---
## Problem Statement

Consumer credit default costs financial institutions billions annually. Traditional manual underwriting misses complex patterns, and loan officers spend countless hours manually extracting data from messy bank statements.

This project solves both problems by building a **complete credit risk pipeline**. It includes an **Automated Underwriting Copilot** that uses an LLM to extract data from raw PDFs, runs it through the machine learning model, relies on SHAP explainability, and enforces a "Human-in-the-Loop" workflow for grey-zone risk predictions.

## Features

- **Agentic AI Copilot** — LangChain-powered ReAct agent that automates document data extraction and context-aware financial Q&A (Powered by Groq Llama 3.3).
- **Automated Underwriting OCR** — Intelligent PDF text parsing connected directly to the structured feature pipeline models.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Risk Profiling** — Grey-zone escalation flow requiring manual review when AI confidence dips below safe thresholds.
- **Full ML Pipeline** — data ingestion, feature engineering, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and serving
- **Explainability** — SHAP-based feature importance analysis for every prediction (why did the model decide this?)
- **Production UI** — dark-themed fintech dashboard built with Streamlit, responsive and deployment-ready
- **Engineered Features** — 8 derived financial indicators (credit utilization, payment ratio, delay severity, bill trends)
- **Data-Driven Insights** — automated risk factor analysis explaining each prediction with color-coded reasoning
- **Deployment-Ready** — environment variable configuration, absolute path resolution, single-command launch

## Model Performance

| Metric | Score |
|---|---|
| **ROC-AUC** | ~0.75 |
| **Algorithm** | Logistic Regression |
| **Training Set** | 30,000 records (UCI Taiwan Credit) |

**Interpretation:** A ROC-AUC of 0.75 indicates the model correctly ranks a random defaulter above a random non-defaulter 75% of the time. While not production-threshold for autonomous decisions, it provides strong directional guidance for human-in-the-loop lending workflows.

## Usage

### Run the Dashboard & AI Copilot

The dashboard is now a multi-page app. The home page is the manual risk analyzer, and the sidebar contains the AI Underwriting Copilot.

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Opens at **http://localhost:8501**

### Generate Sample Statement
If you want to test the AI Copilot without using a real bank statement, generate the dummy PDF by running:

```bash
python scripts/generate_sample_pdf.py
```
This will create a `samples/sample_statement.pdf` file you can upload to the Copilot.

### Run the Notebooks

Execute in order for full pipeline reproduction:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/
```

1. `01_eda.ipynb` — data exploration and visualization
2. `02_preprocession_feature_scaling.ipynb` — preprocessing pipeline
3. `03_model_training.ipynb` — model training and evaluation
4. `04_shap_explainability.ipynb` — SHAP analysis

### Retrain the Model

```bash
python src/train.py
```
